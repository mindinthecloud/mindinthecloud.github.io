During &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion.html"&gt;his talk at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TED2008&lt;/span&gt; on &amp;#8216;classical music and passion&amp;#8217;&lt;/a&gt; he refers to
a moment of &amp;#8216;enlightenment&amp;#8217; as I would call&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was 45 years old, I&amp;#8217;d been conducting for 20 years, and I suddenly
had a realization. The conductor of an orchestra doesn&amp;#8217;t make a
sound.&amp;nbsp;(&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He depends, for his power, on his ability to make other people
powerful. And that changed everything for me. It was totally life
changing.&amp;nbsp;(&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people. And of
course, I wanted to know whether I was doing that. And you know how
you find out? You look at their eyes. If their eyes are shining, you
know you&amp;#8217;re doing it.&amp;nbsp;(&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the eyes are not shining, you get to ask a question. And this is
the question: who am I being, that my players&amp;#8217; eyes are not&amp;nbsp;shining?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, now that&amp;#8217;s what I would call enlightenment. &amp;#8220;My job is to awaken
possibility is other people&amp;#8221;. That resonates with me, deep inside.
Servant&amp;nbsp;leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin extends this insight to parenthood, generalizes this to his
vision of&amp;nbsp;succes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do that with our children, too. Who am I being, that my
children&amp;#8217;s eyes are not shining? That&amp;#8217;s a totally different&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&amp;#8230;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know, I have a definition of success. For me, it&amp;#8217;s very
simple. It&amp;#8217;s not about wealth and fame and power. It&amp;#8217;s about how
many shining eyes I have around&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice how he phrases this. It&amp;#8217;s not &amp;#8220;how am I &lt;em&gt;behaving&lt;/em&gt;, that their
eyes are not shining?&amp;#8221; but &amp;#8220;how am I &lt;strong&gt;being&lt;/strong&gt;?&amp;#8221; That&amp;#8217;s a far deeper way
to look at it. Fundamental. Existential. &amp;#8220;Who am I &lt;strong&gt;being&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8220;? Who can I
&lt;strong&gt;be&lt;/strong&gt; for others so that their eyes are&amp;nbsp;shining?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question shifts our focus. It&amp;#8217;s not primarily about &lt;strong&gt;doing&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s
all about &lt;strong&gt;being&lt;/strong&gt;. Because who we are is the source of our doing. Our
identity, our views of who we are and our purpose in life, is the driver
for all that we do. It also shifts our focus from ourselves to the
other. Though we ask what &lt;strong&gt;we&lt;/strong&gt; are being, we define that in terms of
our impact on&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who am I&amp;nbsp;being&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that my spouse&amp;#8217;s eyes are not&amp;nbsp;shining?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that my children&amp;#8217;s eyes are not&amp;nbsp;shining?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that my colleague&amp;#8217;s eyes are not&amp;nbsp;shining?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that my team&amp;#8217;s eyes are not&amp;nbsp;shining?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;that my congregation&amp;#8217;s eyes are not&amp;nbsp;shining?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and we can extend this question to each and every relation we have in
this&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Takeoffs are optional. Landings are&amp;nbsp;mandatory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you push the stick forward, the houses get bigger. If you pull the stick back, they get&amp;nbsp;smaller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flying isn&amp;#8217;t dangerous. Crashing is&amp;nbsp;dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always better to be down here wishing you were up there than up there wishing you were down&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The only time you have too much fuel is when you&amp;#8217;re on&amp;nbsp;fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The propeller is just a big fan in front of the plane used to keep the pilot cool. When it stops, you can actually watch the pilot start&amp;nbsp;sweating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When in doubt, hold on to your altitude. No one has ever collided with the&amp;nbsp;sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &amp;#8220;good&amp;#8221; landing is one from which you can walk away. A &amp;#8220;great&amp;#8221; landing is one after which they can use the plane&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn from the mistakes of others. You won&amp;#8217;t live long enough to make all of them&amp;nbsp;yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know you&amp;#8217;ve landed with the wheels up if it takes full power to taxi to the&amp;nbsp;ramp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The probability of survival is inversely proportional to the angle of arrival. Large angle of arrival equals a small probability of survival &amp;#8212; and vice&amp;nbsp;versa.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never let an airplane take you somewhere your brain didn&amp;#8217;t get to five minutes&amp;nbsp;earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay out of clouds. The silver lining everyone keeps talking about might be another airplane going in the opposite&amp;nbsp;direction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reliable sources also report that mountains have been known to hide out in&amp;nbsp;clouds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three simple rules for making a smooth landing. Unfortunately, no one knows what they&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You start with a bag full of luck and an empty bag of experience. The trick is to fill the bag of experience before you empty the bag of&amp;nbsp;luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep looking around. There&amp;#8217;s always something you&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all you can see out of the windscreen is ground that&amp;#8217;s going round and round and all you can hear is commotion coming from the passenger compartment, things are not at all as they should&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the ongoing battle between objects made of aluminum going hundreds of miles per hour and the ground going zero miles per hour, the ground has yet to&amp;nbsp;lose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good judgment comes from experience. Unfortunately, experience usually comes from bad&amp;nbsp;judgment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s always a good idea to keep the pointy end going forward as much as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are old pilots and there are bold pilots.  There are, however, no old, bold&amp;nbsp;pilots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember, gravity is not just a good idea.  It&amp;#8217;s the law.  And it&amp;#8217;s not subject to&amp;nbsp;appeal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always try to keep the number of landings you make equal to the number of takeoffs you&amp;#8217;ve&amp;nbsp;made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The three most useless things to a pilot are altitude above you, runway behind you, and a tenth of a second&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a&amp;nbsp;bonus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helicopters can&amp;#8217;t fly; they&amp;#8217;re just so ugly the earth repels&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Nothing can be changed about what is passed. Whatever has happened stays happened. Forever. Only our memories can change. And they &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; change, that&amp;#8217;s for sure. Because every time we revisit a memory we are in fact &lt;em&gt;re-creating&lt;/em&gt; it, &lt;em&gt;re-shaping&lt;/em&gt; it, changing&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow is uncertain. What we &amp;#8216;know for sure&amp;#8217; about tomorrow is nothing more than an extrapolation of our past experiences. Which are uncertain by themselves, since our memories are volatile and&amp;nbsp;unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yesterday is a memory, tomorrow is a dream; today is a gift, that&amp;#8217;s why it&amp;#8217;s called &amp;#8220;present&amp;#8221;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing we have is today, now. Actually not even that much; all we have is just this very&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter the circumstances or events that got us here. No matter whether we like it or not. No matter the path behind us or the path before us. We are right here, right now, and that&amp;#8217;s all we have. That&amp;#8217;s what we have to deal with, that&amp;#8217;s what we have to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these circumstances; comfortable, hard or even&amp;nbsp;painful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;these people, whether we like them or&amp;nbsp;not&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this task, this job, this resonsibility, this&amp;nbsp;opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever we may posess, whatever influence we may think we have, bottom line is that we have very little. Just&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now what? What are you going to do with what you do&amp;nbsp;have?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;#8217;s nothin&amp;#8217; behind me and nothin&amp;#8217; that ties me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To somethin&amp;#8217; that might have been true yesterday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomorrow is open, right now it seems to be more than enough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;to just be here today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Every successful enterprise requires three men - a
dreamer, a businessman and a son-of-a-bitch&amp;#8221; -Peter&amp;nbsp;MacArthur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/ptarkkonen/status/295095179155742720"&gt;Tweet from Petteri&amp;nbsp;Tarkkonen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This quote suggests that there are several distinct roles that have to
be present in a group for any endeavour to be&amp;nbsp;succesfull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tree roles correspond to those of the wizard, the king and the
warrior that Tony Robbins used in his pattern of indirect negotiation
during an intervention at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.rmtcenter.com/creating-leadership-in-times-of-crisis/"&gt;a seminar on september 11th 2001&lt;/a&gt;.
The only role that is missing is &amp;#8216;the&amp;nbsp;fool&amp;#8217;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fool is the only one that can redicule anyone, including the king,
and go unpunished. This role is crucial in limiting unrealistic ambitions,
yes-men and misleading advisors. With mild or not-so-mild humor he pulls
you back into reality, gets both your feet firmly on the ground and
maybe even slaps reality straight in your face.
The role of the fool is extremely underappreciated in a corporate culture
that relies on heavily paid consultants who do not dare to risk their precious
billable hours by pinching illusions and unrealistc&amp;nbsp;ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former manager of mine used this&amp;nbsp;mantra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
You are either part of the solution or part of the problem.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to oppose this with another&amp;nbsp;observation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If you cannot solve the problem you can still make good money by
prolonging it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still in many organisations external consultants are far better paid than
regular staff. Someone bold (or naieve) enough to know better &amp;#8212;or even worse&amp;#8212;
exposes the inflated pretentions of a hired &amp;#8216;advisior&amp;#8217; can count on resistance
and even repercussions. It might be in the form of a bad review in the annual
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HR&lt;/span&gt; performance evaluation cyle, promotion to a position of less influence,
no renewal of his temporary job contract or downright getting&amp;nbsp;fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wiser of the kings of old ages new the value of a &amp;#8216;fool&amp;#8217;. Someone who is
officially appointed to be politically incorrect and critical can stir the beneficial
effects of (self-)reflection. Which is very beneficial to both the truely valuable advisior
and the potential victim of a trader in inflated&amp;nbsp;expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plead for a re-institution in any large organisation of the position of &amp;#8216;the fool&amp;#8217;,
as a counter-force to both lethal complacency to the status quo and unsustainable&amp;nbsp;disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
