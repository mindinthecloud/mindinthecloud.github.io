  <div>
    <p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This hospital bed is equipped with a smart device that stores all the
patient&#8217;s data.&#8221; Just a phrase in a discussion about an imaginary
case of interconnected devices, also know as <em>&#8216;The Internet of Things&#8217;</em>.
This made me wonder: what is a &#8216;Smart&nbsp;Device&#8217;?</p>
<p>In this article I&#8217;ll try to create some clarity around this&nbsp;concept.</p>
<p>From the context one thing was clear: a smart device is just a &#8216;thing&#8217;
in the internet of things. A just slightly funny game of words that adds
little to a better understanding of the concept. But the context of
&#8216;internet&#8217; provides us at least with a first question to&nbsp;answer.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>Is a &#8216;smart device&#8217; internetworked by&nbsp;itself?</em></dt>
<dd>Should it have it&#8217;s own <span class="caps">IP</span> network&nbsp;stack?</dd>
</dl>
<p>I tend to answer this by defining a smart device as accessible from the
internet, be it by it&#8217;s own <span class="caps">IP</span> stack or by means of some kind of gateway
or bridge. This implies that one can transform a <em>&#8216;dumb device&#8217;</em> into a
smart one by simply adding some kind of electronic circuitry that
provides it with an <span class="caps">IP</span> network stack. This has been done for far over a
decade by equipment called <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_server">terminal servers</a>
(the traditional type, not the kind that made Citrix a big player in the
corporate world). These devices provided access over <span class="caps">IP</span> to equipment that only had serial
interfaces conforming to standards like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232"><span class="caps">RS</span>-232</a>
or <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-422"><span class="caps">RS</span>-422</a>.</p>
<p>With only this definition a simple sensor &#8212;like a thermometer&#8212;
equipped with a serial interface and connected to a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_server">terminal server</a>
would qualify as a &#8216;smart device&#8217;. We need to add another&nbsp;aspect.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><em>What makes a device&nbsp;&#8216;smart&#8217;?</em></dt>
<dd>&#8230;besides being&nbsp;internetworked?</dd>
</dl>
<p>For this aspect I would like to add two characteristics for a device to
qualify as being&nbsp;&#8216;smart&#8217;:</p>
<!-- #. it has to be able to store information that can be retrieved *upon request*. -->
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>its functionality can be changed without any physical&nbsp;contact</li>
<li>its functionality can be extended or modified beyond what was previously&nbsp;available</li>
</ol>
<p>Take for instance an <span class="caps">IP</span>-connected videocamera. The functionality of such
a device can be modified, by nature the <span class="caps">IP</span> network stack at least. Maybe
the focus can be adjusted as well, or it can tilt and pan on command. But
I would not qualify is as smart, because its functionality is fixed. At
least as long as there is no means of remotely loading it with new
software. If the software code is &#8216;frozen&#8217; in read-only memory and the
device itself provides no means of altering the code without a physical
connection I would consider such a device as merely&nbsp;&#8216;programmable&#8217;.</p>
<p>A game console on the other hand can very well be considered &#8216;smart&#8217;. It
is provided with writeable memory that
can be loaded with functionality (programs) that can be retrieved from a
remote location. It gets a little slippery here; ane can imagine edge
cases like game consoles that only accept memory cards but have no
network stack. But those are not internetworked and are disqualified from
the &#8216;internet of&nbsp;things&#8217;.</p>
